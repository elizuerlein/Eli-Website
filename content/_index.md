        I'm studying Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology at the University of Washington. Right now that means volunteering at the UW greenhouse, working through an independent study using R to visualize gene expression data, and figuring out what research I want to pursue next.

        Outside the lab, I'm Recruitment VP for Triangle Fraternity, climb with the UW Climbing Team, and spend a lot of time on the ceramics wheel.
